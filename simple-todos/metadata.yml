description: "For my new job as a San Franisco tour guide, I totally realized that I can use the Meteor [simple-todos tutorial](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app)! It was really easy, the app works perfectly by step 9 of the tutorial, you don't even need to write your own 'publish and subscribe' code! It's all done for you!"
