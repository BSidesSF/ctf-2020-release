Slice bananas and set aside.
Cut a circle around the top of the sourdough bread bowl and hollow out the inside.
For an added bonus, toast the bread bowl for extra crispiness and warmth.
Follow the melting instructions for the dipping chocolate of your choice (we used dark chocolate) and pour the melted chocolate into the bread bowl.  Top with a sprinkle of sea salt.
