description:
  In December of 2019, many of the hosts in the BSidesSF organization were
  compromised.  We think we traced it to this modified version of PuTTY, but
  we can't figure out what data was being sent.  When we analyze it on another
  host, we see nothing strange, but on the management hosts, we think it was
  beaconing home.  Can you find out what it was sending?
