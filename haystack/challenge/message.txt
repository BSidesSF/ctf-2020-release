This message is encoded using a technique called "Chaffing and Winnowing"[1],
a technique that was first published by Ron Rivest in an article published on
the 18th of March 1998 (1998/03/18).  Unfortunately, my implementation of the
technique suffers from very significant flaws, not the least of which is the
failure to include a counter within the the MAC'd portion of the data.  This
leads to all valid bytes with the same value having the same MAC, which should
allow for a fairly trivial frequency analysis attack on the message.
Ultimately, if you're reading this, then you've found *some* way to crack the
encoding applied here.

Chaffing and winnowing also leads to a pretty major blow up in size.  Imagine
if, instead of 31 bytes of chaff per byte of message, I had used the maximum
255.  Imagine that I used a 256-bit MAC instead of 128.  (256 bits: military
grade crypto!!@!)

At this point, you've been patient enough through my diatribe (which is really
just to give you the plaintext you need to launch your attack against the output
of this encoding).  What you're really here for is the FLAG.  Like most of our
other flags, this is in the typical CTF{} format.
