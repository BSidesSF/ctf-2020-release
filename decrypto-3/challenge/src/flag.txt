PR_SET_DUMPABLE (since Linux 2.3.20)
Set the state of the "dumpable"
flag, which determines whether core dumps are produced for the calling process
upon delivery of a signal whose default behavior is to produce a core dump.

MADV_DONTDUMP (since Linux 3.4)
Exclude from a core dump those pages in the range specified by addr and length.
This is useful in applications that have large areas of memory that are known
not to be useful in a core dump. The effect of MADV_DONTDUMP takes precedence
over the bit mask that is set via the /proc/PID/coredump_filter file (see
core(5)).


Man, if only I'd known about those options before I dumped core and sent it out.
