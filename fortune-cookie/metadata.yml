description:
  Fortune Cookies are believed to have been invented by Asian-American
  immigrants here on the west coast.  It's not certain exactly when or where,
  but what is known is that they're a staple in the wonderful restaurants of
  San Francisco's Chinatown.  They're also floating around the conference!  If
  you find one, it might hold more than a fortune for you.
